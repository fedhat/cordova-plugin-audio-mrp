# cordova-plugin-audio-mrp


This plugin provides the ability to record and play back audio files on an iOS device. It was forked from a fork of cordova-plugin-media and then heavily modified.

__NOTE__: The current implementation does not adhere to a W3C
specification for media capture, and is provided for convenience only.
A future implementation will adhere to the latest W3C specification
and may deprecate the current APIs.


Although in the global scope, it is not available until after the `deviceready` event.

    document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
    function onDeviceReady() {
        console.log(Media);
    }

## Installation
